# Bayesian Optimization
In this example a bayesian framework is defined to tune hyperparameter of a CNN using hyperopt library developed https://github.com/hyperopt
Bayesian optimization is a seuential model-based approach to solving problems. In particular, we prescribe a prior belief over the possible objective functions and then sequentially refine this model as data are observed via our updated beliefs-given data-on the likely ojective function we are optimizing.

This blog summarises bayesian optimization very thoroughly.

The CNN is used to model fashion MNIST dataset.
